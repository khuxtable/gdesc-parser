Java re-implementation of the old B adventure game from 1982.

I have taken some concepts from the ACode adventure framework
that Mike Arnautov maintains, but replaced his minor directive
language with my own language, which has a C-like syntax.

This is very much a work in progress.
Not all features are implemented yet.
